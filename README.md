# Speaker Control

## What I'll do next:

https://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/bluetooth-module-noise-issue/msg922245/#msg922245  

Hook an isolators up somehow.
It takes a 5v Vin and produces an identical Vout but completely isolated, supposedly so that would. I mean it'd get rid of any ground loop. 
Not sure about the bluetooth sounds as such but hopefully they vanish.
Failing that - try powering it from a battery, if it works like that.. it could be a shielding problem or yeah some kind of interference situation.
Alteratively, I could power the arduino and the bluetooth thing completely separately (although they'd still need ground connecting)

## Also 

I also have a new bk8000l on the way, on a nice breakout board with a 5V input. A v3 might be in order (sigh!).
Perhaps do a PCB at that point.. cos damn.
